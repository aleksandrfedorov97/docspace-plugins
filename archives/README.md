## Overview

Open and extract ZIP archives.

## How to configure

To start working with the plugin, it is not needed to change the default settings.

In case you want to adjust the plugin settings, go to *Settings -> Integration -> Plugins* and click on the gear symbol next to the Archives plugin.

## How to use

The plugin enables you to unzip archives directly in DocSpace. To get started, simply open the context menu for the archive file, navigate to the **Actions section**, and choose your preferred option.

- **Open archive**: View the contents of the archive without unzipping it. You can also extract specific files directly from the preview window.
- **Choose location to unzip**: Select a specific location to extract the entire archive.
- **Unzip here**: Extract the archive directly into the current folder or room where it is stored.
