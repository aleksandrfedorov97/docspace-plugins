## Overview

View and edit images in DocSpace.

## How to configure

To start working with the plugin, it is not needed to change the default settings.

In case you want to adjust the plugin settings, go to *Settings -> Integration -> Plugins* and click on the gear symbol next to the ImageEditor plugin.

## How to use

To use the plugin, right-click on an image file in the file list and select **Edit Image** from the context menu.

**Supported formats:** .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .svg, .bmp, .tiff, .ico

An image editor pop-up will open, featuring a toolbar on the right with various tools such as **Resize, Crop, Flip, Rotate, Draw, Shape, Icon, Text,** and **Mask**. Once you've made your edits, click the **Save and Exit** button at the bottom to apply the changes.

After saving, a notification will confirm the successful update, and the file version will be updated accordingly.

When you open the file using a standard image viewer in DocSpace, the latest version of the image will be displayed.
